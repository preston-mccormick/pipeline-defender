Create a web game with react and node backend.

The game is called Pipeline vs Rust.  At the bottom of the screen is a pipeline.  The player controls a technician who can move from side to side. The technician is wearing a backpack with a wire connected to a cane. Enemy projectiles fall from the top of the screen. Some examples are rust monsters and water droplets. The player moves from side to side using the arrow keys or A and D keys or mouse and when the technician gets close to an enemy projectile, zaps it with the cane. If enemy projectiles reach the pipeline, it starts to rust and crack. If too many projectiles reach the pipeline, it explodes. If the player lasts for one minute, they advance to the next level, where the projectiles move slightly faster. Add some sound effects, a pause button, a quit button, and a restart button.
